# Models

## NMR models

The below binding models are available to fit Nuclear Magnetic Resonance titration data.

* NMR 1:1
* NMR 1:2
* NMR 2:1
* NMR Dimer Aggregation
* NMR CoEK Aggregation

## UV models

The following binding models are available to fit UV or UV-Vis spectroscopic titration data. These models can also be used for fluorescence titration if the free guest is "silent" (non-fluorescent) and dynamic quenching is absent.

* UV 1:1
* UV 1:2
* UV 2:1
* UV Dimer Aggregation
* UV CoEK Aggregation
