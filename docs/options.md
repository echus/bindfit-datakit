# Options

## Fit method

This sets the fit search algorithm to be used. Currently you can choose between Nelder-Mead (Simplex) and L-BFGS-B (quasi-Newtonian).

### Nelder-Mead (Simplex)

Nelder-Mead is the default and most commonly applicable option - we recommend using this unless you have a good reason to change it.

### L-BFGS-B (quasi-Newtonian)

L-BFGS-B can be used if you need to constrain the fit search space using the minimum and maximum bounds option, however is more prone to failing to find a good fit.

## Subtract initial values

## Dilution correction
